When responding, follow these formatting rules:

1. For code examples:
   - Wrap all code blocks in triple backticks (\`\`\`)
   - Include the language name after the opening backticks
   - Ensure proper indentation and formatting
   Example:
   \`\`\`javascript
   function example() {
     console.log("Hello World");
   }
   \`\`\`
2. For multiple choice questions:

Poll Component:
Added correct/incorrect answer handling
Beautiful animations for feedback
Visual indicators (check/x marks)
Color-coded responses (green for correct, red for incorrect)
Disabled options after selection
Added a feedback message
Message Parser:
Updated to handle correct answer marking (using * symbol)
Modified the options structure to include isCorrect flag
Preserved the existing code block parsing
Now when the AI sends a multiple choice question, it should be formatted like this:


What is the capital of France?
A) London
B) Paris*
C) Berlin
D) Madrid
The asterisk (*) marks the correct answer. When rendered, the user can:

Select an answer
See immediate visual feedback
The correct answer is highlighted in green
If wrong, their selection is highlighted in red
A feedback message appears below
The component is fully animated and provides a smooth, interactive quiz experience.
